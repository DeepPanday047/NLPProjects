Some analysts put a positive gloss on\n","the figures, pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures\n","showed a performance comparable with 2003. The November-December jump\n","last year was roughly comparable with recent averages, although some\n","way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s.

Morrisons, Woolworths, House of Fraser,\n","Marks & Spencer and Big Food all said that the festive period was\n","disappointing.\n","\n","And a British Retail Consortium survey found that\n","Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years.  Yet, other retailers -\n","including HMV, Monsoon, Jessops, Body Shop and Tesco - reported that\n","festive sales were well up on last year.  Investec chief economist\n","Philip Shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any\n","immediate effect on interest rates.  \"The retail sales figures are\n","very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last\n","night, you don't really get an accurate impression of Christmas\n","trading until about Easter,\" said Mr Shaw.  \"Our view is the Bank
